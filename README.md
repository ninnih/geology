## Overview
This application is using https://macrostrat.org/ API and arcGIS. 
It is a personal project I am building simply for fun, practise and my own interest.
In the application you can currently search and identify Minerals and Lithography. I am currently developing map overviews with ArcGIS and paleogeography data and worldwide bedrock data.
